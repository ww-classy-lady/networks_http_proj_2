# networks: HTTP Request and Response Parsing using Socket
Programmed client-to-server networking using sockets, char arrays, char pointers, macros,
and type FILE in C to parse command line arguments, parse URL to retrieve the hostname,
web file, and file name, send and receive sockets, and dynamically handle HTTP requests
and responses depending on user command line options.

Provided command line options -u, -d, -q, -r, and -o for the current user to input a URL and
a filename then view the HTTP response header and store data into any size and type of file
in the same directory.
